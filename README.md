# <My Pre-Work Study Guide>

## Description

I joined the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp to grow my skills and become a more competent individual in the workforce for computer development. I
built this site to see the complexity and reward involved with creating a 
simple site that is beneficial to my growth and practice with programming.
I now have my own repository, or guide, that i can refer back to when needed. I learned how HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript are linked and work together to create a product that can serve as a reference later on.
